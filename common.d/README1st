All files ending with *.conf get included.

They are included alphabetically.

A File a.conf will get loaded before z.conf. File 1.conf will get loaded before a.conf.
Remmember rc.d ? 04Sxys.sh before 23Sdkjf.sh :).

So modules.conf gets renamed to 0modules.conf because they should be loaded first.
